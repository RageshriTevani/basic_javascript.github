<!-- 
    Miscellaneous events in JavaScript are events that are not related to user interactions with the mouse or keyboard, but are still important for building dynamic and interactive web pages. These events can be used to detect when the user resizes the window, scrolls the page, or focuses on an input element, among other things.

<script>
    
    inputElement.addEventListener('blur', function() {
    console.log('Input element is blurred');
    });

</script>

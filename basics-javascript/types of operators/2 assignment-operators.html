
<!-- In JavaScript, the assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable. The most basic assignment operator is the equals sign (=), which assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. Here's an example: -->

<script>
    
var x = 10;
x += 5; // Addition
// (Equivalent to x = x + 5)

x -= 5; // Subtraction
// (Equivalent to x = x - 5)

x *= 5; // Multiplication 
// (Equivalent to x = x * 5)

x /= 5; // Division assignment
// (Equivalent to x = x / 5)


</script>

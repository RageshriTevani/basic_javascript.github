<!--
    There are three types of variables 
    let var and const which are given as below.

    1) Let : 
    It was introduced in ECMAScript 6 and it has block scope. This means that a variable declared with let is only accessible within the block it is declared in (e.g., within a loop, if statement, or function). It also allows variable reassignment but prevents variable redeclaration within the same scope.

    
    2)Var:

    You can redeclare a variable declared with var in the same scope or child-parent scopes. The variable will be affected in the global scope, or functional scope if it is declared in a function.
    
    
    3) Const:

    const declarations cannot be redeclared by any other declaration in the same scope. const begins declarations, not statements. That means you cannot use a lone const declaration as the body of a block (which makes sense, since there's no way to access the variable).

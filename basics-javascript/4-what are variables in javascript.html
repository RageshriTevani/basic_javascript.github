<!--   
    In JavaScript, variables are containers for storing data values.

    Variables can hold various types of data, including numbers, strings, arrays, objects, functions, and more. In JavaScript, variables are declared using the var, let, or const keywords.

    let and const are block-scoped declarations introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), while var is a function-scoped declaration that has been around since the early days of JavaScript.
